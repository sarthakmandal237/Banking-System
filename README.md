# Banking System Database

## Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a relational database schema for a banking system. The database is built to manage the core functionalities of a banking institution, including customer information, account types, transaction history, and branch details. 

The schema is designed to efficiently store and retrieve data related to customers, their accounts, and any financial operations performed. Key operations include the creation of new customer profiles, the management of various types of bank accounts (such as savings, checking, and fixed deposits), and the handling of transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

Additionally, the database ensures data integrity through the use of appropriate constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique indexes. It also implements transaction management to support secure and consistent financial operations. The design is scalable to accommodate future growth, allowing the addition of new features or expansion of data capacity as needed.

The project includes SQL scripts for creating the database schema, inserting sample data, and running basic queries for common banking operations.
